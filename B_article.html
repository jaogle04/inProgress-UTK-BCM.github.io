            <p>
              Of all the places on campus, UTK's Baptist Collegiate Ministry
              (BCM) seems to always be full of life and activities. Students
              come and go throughout the day to study, eat, chat, and sometimes…
              take a nap. Our little campus house on Melrose Avenue is packed
              with every kind of person. Any room you walk into, you'll find
              college students from all walks of life fellowshipping with one
              another. From Soul Food to spiritual interest surveys, our group
              is ready to serve this campus any way we can to bring people
              closer to Jesus. With attendance each Thursday night- our worship
              session called “TNT” -reaching about 100+ students each week, the
              opportunities to meet new people and build community continue to
              rise. What better way to hear about what happens at the BCM than
              from our very own students? The B was created to bring a more
              personal touch to our latest news.
            </p>
            <p>
              Releasing once a semester, you will be able to read columns from
              undergraduates journaling their experiences in life, missions, and
              a whole lotta Jesus. We want to connect more with our supporters
              and fellow students; that's why you're receiving this newsletter
              today .With an inside look at everything this ministry does, we
              hope you will find this student journal uplifting; because we
              can't do it without you! Prayer is of utmost importance to us here
              at the BCM. Prayer gives life to ministry and fuels every step of
              the Christian walk. In reading these upcoming testimonials from
              our students, we wish to provide you with specific things to pray
              for.

              My experience at the BCM so far has been nothing but awesome. The
              BCM offers an environment for people to get closer to Christ,
              while also making life-long friendships. They also offer life
              groups, which are by far one of the most critical groups a college
              student could get involved in. I have met some of my closest
              friends in my life group and my faith has 100% been strengthened
              because of [it]. Additionally, the BCM holds a worship/service
              every Thursday night at 7:00 called TNT (Thursday Nights
              Together). For me, this is a time to clear my thoughts and feel a
              peace that I cannot feel any other way except through worship. I
              am looking forward to what the future holds for me being a part of
              the BCM, and all of the memories I will inevitably make.

            <p id="editor">Contributor: Trinity Sankey</p>
            <p>
              Fall Retreat 2023 with the BCM was an eye-opening,
              perspective-changing experience that I had the privilege of
              attending. For those who do not know, Fall Retreat is an overnight
              weekend retreat the BCM takes during the fall semester. It is a
              chance to take time with God, learn about different topics, and
              meet others who attend the BCM by doing group bonding. Themed
              retreats are my favorite and the BCM did not disappoint. The theme
              for the weekend was all things toxic. Those who were there got to
              hear about toxic culture, toxic femininity, toxic masculinity,
              toxic religion, and much more. The weekend allowed for
              opportunities to learn about the toxicity that consumes the world
              and have a chance to dissect it with peers. Learning about the
              different topics within toxicity was a highlight of the weekend,
              but other parts have stuck with me since the end of the retreat.
              During the retreat, current students who attend the BCM lead
              panels and devotions that challenge us to ask questions and dive
              deeper into other topics such as greed, pride, and social media in
              our own lives. One topic in particular, pride, was an interesting
              topic that opened the door to the different stages associated with
              pride. It was something that I had never considered. Most people
              try not to be prideful, but the different levels of pride such as
              self-exaltation, self-promotion, self-justification,
              self-degradation, self-demotion, and self-condemnation. These
              various stages of pride challenge the definition people recognize.
              For example, putting yourself down in an unhealthy way is an
              example of one of the stages of pride: self-condemnation. Learning
              about the different levels of pride was an important part of the
              Fall Retreat for me because no one is perfect; we all fall subject
              to one thing or another as we go through life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another part I loved was the toxic femininity talk with all the
              BCM girls led by Samm Hawes. One takeaway I learned was humility
              does not mean making yourself small, but instead giving God all
              the glory in your life. This idea of humility is a perspective
              change that I took into consideration and had to reflect on my
              life. The best part of the weekend, despite everything I already
              mentioned, was having my quiet time in a peaceful, beautiful
              environment where it was just me and God. Everyone's quiet times
              can be different, and for me, I like to take a moment and just
              silently exist in the world God created and listen to life on
              Earth. This personal moment with God during Fall Retreat provided
              me with certainty that I am where God needs me to be in life and I
              am one of His many creations. My moment with God is not to
              discourage others who might not have similar experiences or
              moments alone with God but is a reminder that God does love and
              provide for all of His children in different ways. Every Fall
              Retreat experience varies from person to person. But for me, I
              changed my perspectives of how I view certain things and I let God
              take those burdens. So, if you are considering taking a leap of
              faith into the unknown, or just deciding if attending a retreat is
              worth it, I suggest you pray about it and trust God, because a
              large leap for you can be a small step towards God!

            <p>
              In November, the BCM was able to participate in our 2nd annual
              ServeKnox Week! Students had the opportunity to serve at many
              different locations. We were able to help prepare toys and clothes
              to send to children in rural Appalachia through Mission of Hope,
              write notes of encouragement for friends and family, host a time
              of worship and fellowship at a retirement community, continue to
              support Montgomery Village and Western Heights children's bible
              studies, fellowship and pray for staff at various international
              restaurants around Knoxville, and help run games for Pond Gap
              Elementary's fall festival. We saw a lot of fruitful conversations
              take place as well as many physical needs met. It has been so
              encouraging to see the way that BCM students are passionate about
              serving one another and their community.
            </p>
            <p>
              So many of the students involved at the BCM are serving in some
              capacity whether it is leading a life group, teaching ESL, running
              the tech and lights for TNT, or getting up early to make hot
              chocolate for Coffee Cart. Our students do a wonderful job
              following Jesus's example in serving others. When thinking about
              what it means to serve, I feel that it is always important to
              reorient ourselves to the gospel and remind ourselves of what the
              Lord has done for us. Jesus loved us so much that He was willing
              to face the wrath of God to redeem and reunite our sinful and
              unrighteous souls with Himself. I believe that as we gaze upon the
              gospel and what the Lord has done for us, we will have a deep
              desire to follow and serve the Lord out of love for our great
              savior. Serving others does not earn us salvation or God's
              approval, we have that through Jesus Christ alone. Serving others
              is a natural overflow of the love that we have been shown and a
              desire to obey the One who saved our lives. In light of this
              truth, we can respond in obedience to Jesus's call to care for
              those around us in passages like Mathew 25:35-45. Furthermore, we
              can persevere in doing good like Galatians 6:9 calls us to do. We
              love because He first loved us. We serve because we were made new.
              The God who redeemed us and called us to himself is worthy of all
              of our praise, our service, and our lives.

            <h3 class="section-title">Behind the Booth</h3>
            <h4>Serving Outside of the Spotlight</h4>
            <p id="editor">Contributor: Turner Perry</p>
            <p>
              At the beginning of this year, I jokingly told our worship team
              that our scripture verse for the year should be “He looked upon
              their distress when He heard their cry” (Psalm 106:44). This
              scripture had always seemed to ring true as we finished out our
              previous school year and, while comedic, felt like an accurate way
              of describing life in the booth when gearing up for a new
              semester. Working in the booth is an interesting collection of
              paradoxes. You are involved in every aspect of the service, yet
              doing your job well means you should go completely unnoticed.
              Humility is quite literally the job description because the goal
              of everything done in the booth is to lead the body to connect
              with Christ. We use amps and microphones so that everyone in the
              body can clearly hear the words both spoken and sung, we use
              projectors for our lyrics so that the body knows the lyrics to
              sing, and we use lights to focus our attention so that the room is
              not a distraction. Each role in the booth exists for a specific
              purpose, not to glorify ourselves, our band, or guest speakers,
              but to center the body's focus on God's glory and presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we use our jobs in the booth to establish order and
              familiarity within our worship services, you can never fully
              mitigate chaos. From mics going out mid-sermon to ProPresenter
              shutting down three minutes before the song service, there is no
              way to anticipate what wrinkle may occur from week to week. While
              you desperately try to account for these factors, you must be
              flexible and prepared to change course at a moment's notice. It is
              in these moments that you must remember that God's glory is the
              number one goal. Personally, if my perspective shifts from our
              goal to my stresses, I immediately start to limit God's glory to
              my perception of excellence rather than the glory He always
              displays and deserves. In Haggai, Israel was rebuilding the temple
              but struggled with the fact that it would not be as grand as
              Solomon's temple. However, God made it clear to the people that
              their obedience and faithfulness was the most beautiful temple
              they could build to him within their hearts. Later, God proclaimed
              that he would shake the other nations and provide the very wealth
              and jewels that the Israelites felt they could not account for.
              Like the rest of our Christian walk, excellence should not
              paralyze us, but embolden us in the pursuit of the one who is
              truly excellent and is imparting his own nature to us. While the
              booth is a new adventure each week, it also brings the grandest
              blessings. You get to see every hand that is raised or head that
              is bowed during the song service, or the way classmates minister
              to and pray over one another when they have had a tough week. When
              the music gets quiet, you can hear every voice in the room ringing
              out in worship and recognition of their Savior. Songs that were
              tricky during rehearsal come together seamlessly through the
              Lord's faithfulness and reach the body so personally. Ultimately,
              the story of the booth is striving to lead the body to meet the
              Lord, trusting in His faithfulness to fill in the gaps and faults
              of our humanity.

            <p>
              Of all the places on campus, UTK's Baptist Collegiate Ministry
              (BCM) seems to always be full of life and activities. Students
              come and go throughout the day to study, eat, chat, and sometimes…
              take a nap. Our little campus house on Melrose Avenue is packed
              with every kind of person. Any room you walk into, you'll find
              college students from all walks of life fellowshipping with one
              another. From Soul Food to spiritual interest surveys, our group
              is ready to serve this campus any way we can to bring people
              closer to Jesus. With attendance each Thursday night- our worship
              session called “TNT” -reaching about 100+ students each week, the
              opportunities to meet new people and build community continue to
              rise. What better way to hear about what happens at the BCM than
              from our very own students? The B was created to bring a more
              personal touch to our latest news.
            </p>
            <p>
              Releasing once a semester, you will be able to read columns from
              undergraduates journaling their experiences in life, missions, and
              a whole lotta Jesus. We want to connect more with our supporters
              and fellow students; that's why you're receiving this newsletter
              today .With an inside look at everything this ministry does, we
              hope you will find this student journal uplifting; because we
              can't do it without you! Prayer is of utmost importance to us here
              at the BCM. Prayer gives life to ministry and fuels every step of
              the Christian walk. In reading these upcoming testimonials from
              our students, we wish to provide you with specific things to pray
              for.

            <p>
              My experience at the BCM so far has been nothing but awesome. The
              BCM offers an environment for people to get closer to Christ,
              while also making life-long friendships. They also offer life
              groups, which are by far one of the most critical groups a college
              student could get involved in. I have met some of my closest
              friends in my life group and my faith has 100% been strengthened
              because of [it]. Additionally, the BCM holds a worship/service
              every Thursday night at 7:00 called TNT (Thursday Nights
              Together). For me, this is a time to clear my thoughts and feel a
              peace that I cannot feel any other way except through worship. I
              am looking forward to what the future holds for me being a part of
              the BCM, and all of the memories I will inevitably make.

            <p>
              Fall Retreat 2023 with the BCM was an eye-opening,
              perspective-changing experience that I had the privilege of
              attending. For those who do not know, Fall Retreat is an overnight
              weekend retreat the BCM takes during the fall semester. It is a
              chance to take time with God, learn about different topics, and
              meet others who attend the BCM by doing group bonding. Themed
              retreats are my favorite and the BCM did not disappoint. The theme
              for the weekend was all things toxic. Those who were there got to
              hear about toxic culture, toxic femininity, toxic masculinity,
              toxic religion, and much more. The weekend allowed for
              opportunities to learn about the toxicity that consumes the world
              and have a chance to dissect it with peers. Learning about the
              different topics within toxicity was a highlight of the weekend,
              but other parts have stuck with me since the end of the retreat.
              During the retreat, current students who attend the BCM lead
              panels and devotions that challenge us to ask questions and dive
              deeper into other topics such as greed, pride, and social media in
              our own lives. One topic in particular, pride, was an interesting
              topic that opened the door to the different stages associated with
              pride. It was something that I had never considered. Most people
              try not to be prideful, but the different levels of pride such as
              self-exaltation, self-promotion, self-justification,
              self-degradation, self-demotion, and self-condemnation. These
              various stages of pride challenge the definition people recognize.
              For example, putting yourself down in an unhealthy way is an
              example of one of the stages of pride: self-condemnation. Learning
              about the different levels of pride was an important part of the
              Fall Retreat for me because no one is perfect; we all fall subject
              to one thing or another as we go through life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another part I loved was the toxic femininity talk with all the
              BCM girls led by Samm Hawes. One takeaway I learned was humility
              does not mean making yourself small, but instead giving God all
              the glory in your life. This idea of humility is a perspective
              change that I took into consideration and had to reflect on my
              life. The best part of the weekend, despite everything I already
              mentioned, was having my quiet time in a peaceful, beautiful
              environment where it was just me and God. Everyone's quiet times
              can be different, and for me, I like to take a moment and just
              silently exist in the world God created and listen to life on
              Earth. This personal moment with God during Fall Retreat provided
              me with certainty that I am where God needs me to be in life and I
              am one of His many creations. My moment with God is not to
              discourage others who might not have similar experiences or
              moments alone with God but is a reminder that God does love and
              provide for all of His children in different ways. Every Fall
              Retreat experience varies from person to person. But for me, I
              changed my perspectives of how I view certain things and I let God
              take those burdens. So, if you are considering taking a leap of
              faith into the unknown, or just deciding if attending a retreat is
              worth it, I suggest you pray about it and trust God, because a
              large leap for you can be a small step towards God!

            <p>
              In November, the BCM was able to participate in our 2nd annual
              ServeKnox Week! Students had the opportunity to serve at many
              different locations. We were able to help prepare toys and clothes
              to send to children in rural Appalachia through Mission of Hope,
              write notes of encouragement for friends and family, host a time
              of worship and fellowship at a retirement community, continue to
              support Montgomery Village and Western Heights children's bible
              studies, fellowship and pray for staff at various international
              restaurants around Knoxville, and help run games for Pond Gap
              Elementary's fall festival. We saw a lot of fruitful conversations
              take place as well as many physical needs met. It has been so
              encouraging to see the way that BCM students are passionate about
              serving one another and their community.
            </p>
            <p>
              So many of the students involved at the BCM are serving in some
              capacity whether it is leading a life group, teaching ESL, running
              the tech and lights for TNT, or getting up early to make hot
              chocolate for Coffee Cart. Our students do a wonderful job
              following Jesus's example in serving others. When thinking about
              what it means to serve, I feel that it is always important to
              reorient ourselves to the gospel and remind ourselves of what the
              Lord has done for us. Jesus loved us so much that He was willing
              to face the wrath of God to redeem and reunite our sinful and
              unrighteous souls with Himself. I believe that as we gaze upon the
              gospel and what the Lord has done for us, we will have a deep
              desire to follow and serve the Lord out of love for our great
              savior. Serving others does not earn us salvation or God's
              approval, we have that through Jesus Christ alone. Serving others
              is a natural overflow of the love that we have been shown and a
              desire to obey the One who saved our lives. In light of this
              truth, we can respond in obedience to Jesus's call to care for
              those around us in passages like Mathew 25:35-45. Furthermore, we
              can persevere in doing good like Galatians 6:9 calls us to do. We
              love because He first loved us. We serve because we were made new.
              The God who redeemed us and called us to himself is worthy of all
              of our praise, our service, and our lives.

            <h4>Serving Outside of the Spotlight</h4>
            <p id="editor">Contributor: Turner Perry</p>
            <p>
              At the beginning of this year, I jokingly told our worship team
              that our scripture verse for the year should be “He looked upon
              their distress when He heard their cry” (Psalm 106:44). This
              scripture had always seemed to ring true as we finished out our
              previous school year and, while comedic, felt like an accurate way
              of describing life in the booth when gearing up for a new
              semester. Working in the booth is an interesting collection of
              paradoxes. You are involved in every aspect of the service, yet
              doing your job well means you should go completely unnoticed.
              Humility is quite literally the job description because the goal
              of everything done in the booth is to lead the body to connect
              with Christ. We use amps and microphones so that everyone in the
              body can clearly hear the words both spoken and sung, we use
              projectors for our lyrics so that the body knows the lyrics to
              sing, and we use lights to focus our attention so that the room is
              not a distraction. Each role in the booth exists for a specific
              purpose, not to glorify ourselves, our band, or guest speakers,
              but to center the body's focus on God's glory and presence.

              While we use our jobs in the booth to establish order and
              familiarity within our worship services, you can never fully
              mitigate chaos. From mics going out mid-sermon to ProPresenter
              shutting down three minutes before the song service, there is no
              way to anticipate what wrinkle may occur from week to week. While
              you desperately try to account for these factors, you must be
              flexible and prepared to change course at a moment's notice. It is
              in these moments that you must remember that God's glory is the
              number one goal. Personally, if my perspective shifts from our
              goal to my stresses, I immediately start to limit God's glory to
              my perception of excellence rather than the glory He always
              displays and deserves. In Haggai, Israel was rebuilding the temple
              but struggled with the fact that it would not be as grand as
              Solomon's temple. However, God made it clear to the people that
              their obedience and faithfulness was the most beautiful temple
              they could build to him within their hearts. Later, God proclaimed
              that he would shake the other nations and provide the very wealth
              and jewels that the Israelites felt they could not account for.
              Like the rest of our Christian walk, excellence should not
              paralyze us, but embolden us in the pursuit of the one who is
              truly excellent and is imparting his own nature to us. While the
              booth is a new adventure each week, it also brings the grandest
              blessings. You get to see every hand that is raised or head that
              is bowed during the song service, or the way classmates minister
              to and pray over one another when they have had a tough week. When
              the music gets quiet, you can hear every voice in the room ringing
              out in worship and recognition of their Savior. Songs that were
              tricky during rehearsal come together seamlessly through the
              Lord's faithfulness and reach the body so personally. Ultimately,
              the story of the booth is striving to lead the body to meet the
              Lord, trusting in His faithfulness to fill in the gaps and faults
              of our humanity.
